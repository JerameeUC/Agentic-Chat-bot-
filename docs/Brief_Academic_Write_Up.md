# Brief Academic Write-Up
*Agentic-Chat-bot â€” Design Rationale, Privacy Controls, and Compliance Posture*

## Abstract
This project implements an **agentic chatbot** with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), session memory, and provider-agnostic connectors. The system emphasizes **modular architecture**, **resilience via graceful degradation**, and **privacy-by-design**. A key contribution is a **private-data header** mechanism that enforces local-only processing, aggressive redaction, and exclusion from bulk AI inputs, thereby mitigating legal and reputational risks associated with data resale and third-party remarketing (e.g., telemarketers undercutting pricing).

## System Overview
- **Modularity:** UI (web/Gradio), routing, NLU, memory/RAG, provider adapters, and guardrails are cleanly separated for testability and substitution.
- **Two Modes:**  
  - *Anonymous/Local*: offline or local-only inference with strict PII controls.  
  - *Logged-in/Cloud*: unifies external providers (OpenAI, Azure, HF, etc.) behind a single interface with timeouts and fallbacks.
- **RAG:** Documents (e.g., storefront policies/FAQs) are chunked and indexed; prompts are grounded to reduce hallucination and maintain domain compliance.
- **Guardrails & Redaction:** PII/PHI detection and masking precede any external call; logging is minimized and configurable.

## Methods
1. **Routing & Orchestration:** Requests pass through middleware: authentication, **privacy header detection**, PII/PHI redaction, policy checks, and capability routing (RAG vs. tools vs. LLM).
2. **Retrieval:** Sparse+dense retrieval with max-passage constraints; citations returned to the UI where applicable.
3. **Resilience:** Provider failures trigger fallback to local rules or safe canned responses; telemetry excludes sensitive content by default.

## Privacy Header for Customer Data
We introduce a deployment-standard header:
```
X-Private-Customer-Data: strict
```

**Semantic Policy (enforced in middleware before any provider call):**
- **Local-Only Processing:** Bypass external providers and long-term storage.
- **Aggressive Redaction:** Highest PII profile (names, emails, phones, addresses, payment tokens, order details); **no raw payload logging**.
- **RAG/Analytics Exclusion:** Do **not** index these sessions; **scrub** them from **bulk AI chat input**, training corpora, and aggregate analytics.
- **Default-Deny Egress:** Block third-party API calls, event streams, or data sharing unless a signed, compliant exception explicitly allows it.

**Business Rationale:**  
This header materially reduces the risk of allegations of **selling customer data** and helps prevent leakage to data brokers and **telemarketing ecosystems** that could target your customers with **lower online prices**, which erodes trust and revenue.

### Example (FastAPI-style Middleware Sketch)
```python
from fastapi import Request, Response

PRIVATE_HEADER = "X-Private-Customer-Data"
STRICT_VALUE   = "strict"

async def privacy_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    private = request.headers.get(PRIVATE_HEADER, "").lower() == STRICT_VALUE
    request.state.private_mode = private

    if private:
        request.state.local_only = True
        request.state.retain_logs = False
        request.state.rag_exclude = True
        request.state.redaction_profile = "max"

    response: Response = await call_next(request)
    return response
```

## Compliance Considerations (incl. HIPAA/Medical)
- **HIPAA Readiness (when handling PHI):**
  - **Minimum Necessary:** Redact and limit exposure to only what is needed for the task.
  - **No Third-Party Egress Without BAA:** External LLM/provider calls **disabled** unless there is a Business Associate Agreement.
  - **Logging & Telemetry:** Content logs disabled; operational logs scrubbed; audit logs retained for access and policy decisions.
  - **Data Lifecycle:** PHI-tagged messages **excluded from RAG indexes** and all analytics/training pipelines; ephemeral session memory with explicit TTLs.
  - **Encryption & Access:** TLS in transit; encrypted at rest; role-based access; periodic key rotation.
- **Consumer Data Protection (non-PHI):**
  - **Do-Not-Sell Policy:** Private header forces a do-not-sell/do-not-share posture for customer data.
  - **Vendor Risk:** Egress controls prevent uncontracted processors from receiving sensitive customer information.
  - **Incident Readiness:** Audit trails for provenance; fast revocation paths; breach notification procedures.

## Evaluation & Threat Model (Brief)
- **Threats:** Data exfiltration (logs, analytics, 3rd-party APIs), prompt injection via retrieved content, ID linkage across sessions, and model inversion via public endpoints.
- **Mitigations:** Private header hard switch, strict PII redaction, retrieval allow-lists, content-security policies for UI, rate limiting, and anomaly detection on output length/entropy.

## Limitations & Future Work
- **Granular Policies:** Move from header-only to **policy objects** (per user, per org, per route) managed by an admin console.
- **Differential Privacy:** Explore noise mechanisms for aggregate analytics that exclude private sessions.
- **Continuous Redaction Tests:** Unit and fuzz tests for PII/PHI detectors; red-team prompt-injection suites.
